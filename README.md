# DEPRECATED
This repository is deprecated. The main functionality (the parsing algorithm) has moved  [here](https://github.com/efjerb/ModelicaParser).

# VC-Modelica-Service
Create and simulate models in Modelica based on BIM input from the API

To setup, first create Python environment with venv in parent folder.  
`python -m venv venv`

Run activation script to activate venv.

To install all necessary packages, run the following command:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
